Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game Engine API
This document outlines the expected functionality and usage of a stateless Python API designed to handle the core game logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This API is intended to be consumed by a Node.js backend, which manages user authentication, game sessions, and statistics.

Overview
The Python API focuses solely on the game engine: determining valid moves, making computer moves (AI), and checking for game outcomes (win, loss, draw). It does not maintain any session state or user information.

API Endpoints (Hypothetical)
The Node.js backend would interact with the Python API via HTTP requests. Below are the expected endpoints:

1. Make a Computer Move
Endpoint: /move

Method: POST

Description: Given the current board state, the API calculates and returns the optimal (or a valid) move for the computer.

Request Body (JSON):

{
    "board": [
        ["X", "", "O"],
        ["", "X", ""],
        ["", "", "O"]
    ],
    "player": "O" // The player whose turn it is (e.g., "O" for computer)
}

Response Body (JSON - Success):

{
    "row": 0,
    "col": 1
}

(Returns the row and column for the computer's move)

Response Body (JSON - Error/No Move):

{
    "error": "No valid moves available"
}

(If the board is full or game is over)

2. Check Game Status
Endpoint: /state

Method: POST

Description: Evaluates the current board state to determine if there's a winner, a draw, or if the game is still ongoing.

Request Body (JSON):

{
    "board": [
        ["X", "", "O"],
        ["", "X", ""],
        ["", "", "O"]
    ]
}

Response Body (JSON - Success):

{
    "status": "ongoing", // or "X_wins", "O_wins", "draw"
    "winner": null       // "X", "O", or null
}

3. Reset game
Endpoint: /reset

Game Logic (Internal to Python API)
The Python API would contain the following core logic:

is_valid_move(board, row, col): Checks if a move at a given (row, col) is valid (i.e., within bounds and the cell is empty).

check_winner(board, player): Determines if the specified player has achieved a winning condition (three in a row, column, or diagonal).

check_draw(board): Determines if the board is full and there is no winner.

get_available_moves(board): Returns a list of all empty cells on the board.

get_computer_move(board, computer_player): Implements the AI for the computer's move. This could range from a simple random move to a more advanced algorithm like Minimax.

Setup and Running (Hypothetical)

Assuming a Flask or FastAPI setup:

Dependencies:

** pip install Flask # or FastAPI, uvicorn **

Run the API:

** python app.py # or uvicorn main:app --reload **
